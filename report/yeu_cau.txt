Project 2: Database implementation
Continue from the previous project, in this project, each student group is responsible for
creating appropriate components for a database system that is in one of the following
categories
 A shopping database
 An online newspaper database
 A social network database
 An e-learning database
Goals of the study
 To practice database implementation using SQL language
 To practice database quality improvement using normalization process
 To practice database performance tuning using indexing structure
 To practice basic database security management
 To develop team work skill
Group information
 You can keep your old group or create a new one
 If you create your new group, send the information to me before 24/11
Requirements
 You are NOT REQUIRED to follow the result of your Project 1
 Create at least 20 tables, each contains at least 20 sample records. DO NOT use a,
b, c, x, y, z, etc. for sample data. Instead, use human-friendly sample data!
 Each table must contain: primary key, foreign key (if there is), index structure,
business rule with CHECK or TRIGGER (if there is)
 Each table must be normalized to at least 3rd normal form
Deliverables
 One report (PDF and hard-copy) containing
o Overall description of the database
o Description about tables, constraints, trigges, index, etc. and SQL
commands to create them

o Description and SQL commands to retrieve data with screenshot of the
returned result if possible (Note: each command is completed on itself, i.e.
no temporary result can be used)
 3 commands having INNER JOIN
 3 commands having OUTER JOIN
 3 commands having subquery
 3 commands having aggregate functions and grouping
 3 commands demonstrating CHECK constraint
 3 commands demonstrating TRIGGER feature
 3 commands having performance gain from indexing structure
o Analyze your system in term of user roles, then create at least 3 users with
3 different security level
 Write necessary SQL commands to create users
 Write necessary SQL commands to GRANT/REVOKE users
permissions
 Write some SQL commands to test if your permission is assigned
correctly

 Presentation
o At the 10th week of the lab
o Each group presents its result in about 20-30 minutes
 Each member needs to answer questions from the teacher individually
